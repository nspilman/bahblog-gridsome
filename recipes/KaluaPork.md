This recipe yields the most delicious pork for nearly zero effort - as long as you give yourself enough lead time for the slow cooking process. Per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81lua) the word Kalua refers to an underground oven, so feel free to put your slow cooker underground, if that is an option.
